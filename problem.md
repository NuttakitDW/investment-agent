# Investment Agent Project - Problem Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the key problems encountered during the development of the Thai Stock (SET) Financial Analysis investment agent.

## Problem 1: Dashboard Lacks Meaningful Insights

### Issue Description
The current dashboard implementation fails to provide actionable insights for investors and bankers.

### Specific Problems
- Basic data visualization without analytical depth
- Missing key financial ratios and comparisons
- No trend analysis or predictive indicators
- Lacks contextual information for decision-making
- No peer comparison or industry benchmarking

### Impact
- Users cannot make informed investment decisions
- Dashboard serves as merely a data display rather than an analytical tool
- Fails to highlight critical warning signs or opportunities

## Problem 2: Web Scraping Limitations

### Issue Description
The scraping bot encounters significant obstacles when attempting to retrieve financial data from SET websites.

### Specific Problems
- SET website implements anti-bot measures (CAPTCHA, rate limiting)
- Dynamic content loading prevents traditional scraping methods
- IP blocking after multiple requests
- JavaScript-rendered content requires complex solutions
- Frequent website structure changes break scrapers

### Technical Challenges
- CloudFlare or similar protection services
- Session management and cookie handling
- User-agent detection and blocking
- API access restrictions or lack of public APIs

### Impact
- Incomplete or outdated financial data
- Inability to automate data collection
- Manual intervention required for data updates
- Reduced scalability and reliability
